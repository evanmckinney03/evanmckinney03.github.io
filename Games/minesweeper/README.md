# Minesweeper-JS
A recreation of minesweeper in Javascript. 
Not percectly coded, but still works. If I were to re-do it,
I would plan out more beforehand and not use svg for everything.
Still could be improved, especially in the look of the overall page.
But for now, it works, but I may revisit it to make it look nicer.
